# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!)

Recently, I wrote an article about how to write very fast JavaScript. Some of the examples took it to the extreme and became very quick at the cost of being totally unmaintainable. There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.

We're going to refactor some pieces of code based off real examples that I've come across. Sometimes I'll need to perform this kind of refactoring on my own code before submitting a PR. Other times I'll do a small refactor of existing code at the start of a story or bug to make my changes easier to implement.

**Scenario 1**

We're an URL-shortening website, like TinyURL. We accept a long URL and return a short URL that forwards visitors to the long URL. We have two functions.

```
// Unrefactored code

const URLstore = [];

function makeShort(URL) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  URLstore.push({[rndName]: URL});
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortURL) {
  for (let i = 0; i < URLstore.length; i++) {
    if (URLstore[i].hasOwnProperty(shortURL) !== false) {
      return URLstore[i][shortURL];
    }
  }
}

```
Problem: what happens if getLong is called with a short URL that isn't in the store? Nothing is explicitly returned so undefined will be returned. Since we're not sure how we're going to handle that, let's be explicit and throw an error so that problems can be spotted during development.

Performance-wise, be careful if you're iterating through a flat array very often, especially if it's a core piece of your program. The refactor here is to change the data-structure of URLstore.

Currently, each URL object is stored in an array. We'll visualize this as a row of buckets. When we want to convert short to long, on average we need to check half of those buckets before we find the correct short URL. What if we have thousands of buckets, and we perform this hundreds of times a second?

The answer is to use some form of hash function, which Maps and Sets use under the surface. A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table. Below, this happens when we place our short URL into the store in makeShort and when we get it back out in getLong. Depending on how you're measuring run time, the result is that on average we only need to check one bucket — no matter how many total buckets there are!

```

const URLstore = new Map(); // Change this to a Map

function makeShort(URL) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  // Place the short URL into the Map as the key with the long URL as the value
  URLstore.set(rndName, URL);
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortURL) {
  // Leave the function early to avoid an unnecessary else statement
  if (URLstore.has(shortURL) === false) {
    throw 'Not in URLstore!';
  }
  return URLstore.get(shortURL); // Get the long URL out of the Map
}

```

For those examples, we assumed that the random function wouldn't clash. 'Cloning TinyURL' is a common system design question and a very interesting one at that. What if the random function does clash? It's easy to tack on addendums about scaling and redundancy.
